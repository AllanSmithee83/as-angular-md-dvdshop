My simple Angular CRUD app with Material Design based on RyanChenkie tutorial - Ultimate AngularJS: Build a Real-World App from Scratch

To run the app, first install the dependencies with NPM.
npm install
Then serve the app with whichever web server you like. You can use http-server for a quick solution.
npm install -g http-server
http-server
